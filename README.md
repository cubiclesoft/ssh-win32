MSYS SSH binaries for 32-bit Windows
====================================

This is an automatically updated repository of MSYS SSH binaries for 32-bit Windows.  Sourced via [SSH extract](https://github.com/cubiclesoft/ssh-extract) which sources from [Git Portable](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

This repository is useful if you just want ssh.exe with a reasonable license but not a bunch of other command-line utils.

64-bit binaries are available here:  https://github.com/cubiclesoft/ssh-win64
